In the current market, finding a sketch artist to draw your potrait is impossible. But tension not, ThinkArt covers you. One has to just upload an image whose sketch he/she wants and within mere seconds a sketch will be generated by an AI algorithm and it can be directly ordered by the customers.

## Conclusion
In the current market, there is no proper application around the monopoly of paintings. With ThinkArt, we are providing features that will cover A-Z of anyone who wants to buy/understand a painting and also employ/give work to artists/painters who are out of jobs because of closed Art galleries/public art auctions. This is a platform for artists/painters to showcase their work and also customers to enjoy the art and buy happiness in their house. We aim to provide a bridge between artists/painters and common people/customers and thereby uplifting this niche industry and bring happiness to everyone.
